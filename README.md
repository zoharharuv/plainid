## What I did
 
I nested the components as much as I could, tryed to achieve clean code,
in this project I haven't used Redux because i think it would
be overkill.
I used asynchronous functions to demonstrate a situation
where you query from backend to get the data.
I also used debounce for the search bar.

For the Resource info window(main modal in middle) I've used a reusable class
called "card" with equal properties, it acts as a container.
